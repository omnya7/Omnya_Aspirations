Our aspirations are the core of what keeps us moving through life. So, my aspiration in my life is to find my goals and dreams in real life and to achieve it successfully.
I have good knowledge in web development at front-end development and user interface design,
also I have been worked on a website in ASP.NET program that contains these languages: javascript, C#, HTML, and CSS.
I'm looking forward to new opportunities and learning new things such as React Native, Flutter, and Mobile web applications.
day after day I used to learn new things in ICT and I recognize that whatever it cost do not give up on your dreams.
So in conclusion I believe someday I will achieve my goals and dreams and become someone reliable and confidant at work and depending on myself in each case I face.
